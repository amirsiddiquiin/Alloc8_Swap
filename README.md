# Socket.tech Token Swap Widget

A cross-chain token swap widget built with Next.js, React, TailwindCSS, and Socket.tech integration. This project allows users to swap tokens across different blockchains (e.g., USDC on Polygon ‚Üí ETH on Arbitrum) with a seamless user experience.

## üöÄ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19, TailwindCSS 4
- **Web3**: wagmi v2, viem, ethers, RainbowKit v2
- **API Integration**: Socket.tech REST API
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS
- **Theme**: Light/Dark mode support with next-themes

## ‚ú® Features

- Connect wallet via RainbowKit
- Select source and destination tokens and chains
- Set slippage tolerance (0.5%, 1%, 2%, or custom)
- View estimated output and minimum received amount
- Perform ERC-20 approvals when needed
- Execute cross-chain swaps
- View transaction status and details
- Dark/Light theme support
- Responsive design

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_API_KEY=YOUR_ALCHEMY_API_KEY
```

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## üîÑ Implementation Details

### API Integration

This project uses the Socket.tech REST API for cross-chain token swaps. The API is used to:

- Fetch token lists for each chain
- Get quotes for token swaps
- Build and execute transactions
- Handle token approvals

### Design Decisions

- **REST API vs SDK**: Chose to use the REST API directly for more control over the implementation and to reduce bundle size.
- **wagmi/viem vs ethers**: Used wagmi/viem for wallet connections and transactions for better TypeScript support and future compatibility.
- **Component Structure**: Modular components for better maintainability and reusability.

## üì± Responsive Design

The UI is fully responsive and works well on mobile devices, tablets, and desktops.

## üöÄ Deployment

The project can be deployed on Vercel with the following command:

```bash
vercel
```

## üìù License

This project is MIT licensed.
